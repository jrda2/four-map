Sushi Locator
===================

Author: Daniel Estrada at [daniel@dcge.co](daniel@dcge.co)

Summary
===================
This is a project focused on pulling Foursquare's API data to display the nearest Sushi restaurants within specific zip codes in San Francisco.

User Flow
===================
The map will load 30 locations and you are able to click on each marker for additional information on the restaurant. You can also select from the sidebar list, which will activate that specific location's marker. The dropdown of zip codes will allow you to filter based on 4 different zip codes. Then you can select those restaurants from the sidebar. Each location's marker will display information from Foursquare: phone number, checkins, and user interactions.
