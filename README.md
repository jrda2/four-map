# SF Sushi Hunt App

Javascript web app built using Knockout.js, Google Maps API, and Foursquare API.

## User Flow
The map will load 30 locations and you are able to click on each marker for additional information on the restaurant. You can also select from the sidebar list, which will activate that specific location's marker. The dropdown of zip codes will allow you to filter based on 4 different zip codes. Then you can select those restaurants from the sidebar. Each location's marker will display information from Foursquare: phone number, checkins, and user interactions.
